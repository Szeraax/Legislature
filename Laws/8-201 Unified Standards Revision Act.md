# Unified Standards Revision Act

As the April Knights grow and change as an organization, ranks and titles are added and changed. This bill hopes to retroactively provide leeway for old laws to continue to apply as they were intended, preventing certain individuals and ranks from existing in a gray area, and changing naming standards to match.

* Wording is changed in Section 1,  line 2-3, changed from exclusively Sergeants to include all Officers, defined as any rank Sergeant or above.
